                <b>Los Tios Grill</b> describes their dishes as <b>"Fine Tex-Mex & Salvadorean Food.”</b> Los Tios could also be described as a smash hit restaurant with four locations: the first in the trendy Del Ray shopping and dining area of Alexandria,
                followed by a second location on Van Dorn Street in Alexandria, a third in Crystal City, Arlington and recently a new fourth location in Leesburg, Virginia.

                The friendly staff will start you off with tortilla chips and their own version of salsa, and a variety of fun cold drinks. Choose from Horchata, Tamarindo, Maranon, Pina Colada or a Strawberry Daiquiri. Margaritas are a specialty and you can choose from a gold margarita, the el patron, frozen margatitas, or even home made sangria. The bar can make mix up a drink of your choice, or pour you a nice glass of wine
            </p>

        There is also a good Mexican beer selection. For starters, you might want to try a nacho platter, plantanos fritos (fried plaintains served with sour cream), or Camarones al Ajillo (sautéed shrimp with Spanish herbs, fresh garlic and cherry wine).

        The specialty of the house are the Los Tios Fajitas. The beef and chicken have been marinated with a special recipe that includes lime juice, pineapple juice and herbs. The fajitas are served with fresh flour tortillas, refried beans, rice, pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole and sour cream. Fajita choices include chicken, beef, shrimp, vegetables or BBQ ribs. For a special treat, ask about the Super Fajita Grande for two.

                <b>Other favorites include:</b> the Los Tios Carne Asada, a 10 oz. Juicy sirloin center cut, marinated and grilled and served with garlic sauce, fried yucca, white rice, black beans and salad; the especially well done and very tender Lechoncito al Horno, morsels of pork roasted in Spanish style sauce, covered with sautéed Spanish onions, and served with white rice and black beans; Pollo Veracruz, a tasty grilled chicken breast, topped with pico de gallo and melted cheese, and served with a small salad, white rice, and black beans.
                For the seafood lover… Los Tios offers delicious broiled tilapia filet,
                topped with shrimp and fresh cilantro sauce, and served with white rice,
                black beans and vegetables). These are just a few of the dishes from the extensive menu.

    <h3 class="text-center">About the Del Ray Location</h3>
    <p>If you are coming from Crystal City, head south on Mount Vernon Avenue and pass thru Arlandria. Look for Los Tios on your left hand side with umbrellas and sidewalk dining out front.</p>

    <p>From Old Town Alexandria, just come north on Route 1 (Jefferson Davis Hwy) over the new bridge, then left on East Custis,
        right on Mount Vernon Avenue and up 4 blocks to Los Tios on your right.
        If you are thinking of seeing a movie at the theater in Potomac Yards
        and are not interested in eating big chain restaurant food,
        Los Tios is less than a mile due west of the theater.
