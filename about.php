    <p>
        <b>Los Tios Grill</b> describes their dishes as <b>"Fine Tex-Mex & Salvadorean Food.”</b> Los Tios could also be described as a smash hit restaurant with four locations: the first in the trendy Del Ray shopping and dining area of Alexandria,
        followed by a second location on Van Dorn Street in Alexandria, a third in Crystal City, Arlington and recently a new fourth location in Leesburg, Virginia.

        The friendly staff will start you off with tortilla chips and their own version of salsa, and a variety of fun cold drinks. Choose from Horchata, Tamarindo, Maranon, Pina Colada or a Strawberry Daiquiri. Margaritas are a specialty and you can choose from a gold margarita, the el patron, frozen margatitas, or even home made sangria. The bar can make mix up a drink of your choice, or pour you a nice glass of wine

        There is also a good Mexican beer selection. For starters, you might want to try a nacho platter, plantanos fritos (fried plaintains served with sour cream), or Camarones al Ajillo (sautéed shrimp with Spanish herbs, fresh garlic and cherry wine).

        The specialty of the house are the Los Tios Fajitas. The beef and chicken have been marinated with a special recipe that includes lime juice, pineapple juice and herbs. The fajitas are served with fresh flour tortillas, refried beans, rice, pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole and sour cream. Fajita choices include chicken, beef, shrimp, vegetables or BBQ ribs. For a special treat, ask about the Super Fajita Grande for two.
